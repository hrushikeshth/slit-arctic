# ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake Arctic GPT
This Streamlit app is just small demonstration of a general use-case of the new ü§ñ LLM from ‚ùÑÔ∏è Snowflake called Arctic. I'll be updating this or adding new apps for a more specific use-case related to Data Warehousing & Data Modelling functionalities. For now, I'm developing this as the participation project for [The Future of AI is Open (Hackathon)](https://arctic-streamlit-hackathon.devpost.com/).


## Getting your own Replicate API token

To use this app, you'll need to get your own [Replicate](https://replicate.com/) API token.

After creating a Replicate account, you can access your API token from [this page](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).
